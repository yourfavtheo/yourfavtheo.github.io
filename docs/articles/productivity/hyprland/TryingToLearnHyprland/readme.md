I've been using Arch, Ubuntu, Fedora for quite some times now but always using someone else dotfiles, config etc... since i've never had the time to actually sit down and try to play and experiment with my main computer config. I'm not pewdiepie or some guy that has the time to play with .config/hypr for days and days and days lol But throughout this blog I would like to experiment and talk with you as I tinker with my config, add plugins, add stuff and in the end (I know there is no end game) have a stable DE that I can work on, but with some fancy cool effects on my windows and stuff
